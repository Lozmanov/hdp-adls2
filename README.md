# WANdisco Fusion

## Overview

This repository contains a docker-compose configuration that can be used to deploy a fully functional version of WANdisco Fusion with a 30 day evaluation license:

- HDP Sandbox to ADLS Gen2, Live Hive and Databricks integration

Full documentation for this case can be found in our [Quickstart Guide](https://wandisco.github.io/wandisco-documentation/docs/quickstarts/hdp_sandbox_lhv_client-adlsg2_lan)

## Prerequisites
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on a suitable host

## Installation Process
There are a series of steps that must be completed in order to properly deploy and leverage WANdisco Fusion:

1. [Download](https://github.com/WANdisco/hdp-adls2/archive/master.zip) and unzip or git clone the configuration files.

1. Start the cluster(s) with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage
To interact with the Docker Compose stack, ensure you are in the same directory as the `docker-compose` configuration files.

Then, to deploy the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To bring down the containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

To view the status of the deployed containers and port allocations:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
</br>

> Note: The Docker managed volumes persist between container restarts. This ensures that any configuration and database changes are kept once you get up and running. You can remove them if you want to wipe out changes made _after_ initial launch, resetting the volumes, by running `docker-compose down -v`.

### UI Access
Fusion UI is available at http://docker_host:8081

### SSH Access
SSH is configured on ports 2022 and 2522 on Hadoop and Cloudera zone types to allow remote configuration. The key for remote access to these ssh instances is available in the container logs:

```bash
# get the container names for the sshd servers
docker-compose ps
# extract the key, replace with container name from above
docker logs compose_sshd-hdp_1
# after writing to a secure pem file, test remote access
ssh -i cdh-key.pem -p 2022 root@docker_host
```

This ssh instance only makes selected files available to the fusion server via the /etc/sshd_exports volume mount. Any other changes are isolated to the container.
